## RAM/ROM Card

The latest revision of the RAM/ROM card contains up to 64KB of RAM and 32KB of ROM. The mapping of RAM versus ROM can be controlled in software using a single 8-bit register.

## Emulator

The emulator doesn't yet support the configurable RAM/ROM register. This will be added soon.

### v1.0

* First custom PCB with support for 64KB RAM + 32KB ROM.
* Shadowing BANK1 is optional. Those ICs can be omitted.

### v0.1

* Initial hand-wired version with only 32KB RAM and 32KB ROM.
